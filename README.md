# 7 Days to Repair With What?! v0.1 by mr.devolver
Description:
This tool will try to search the mod files for the repairable item of interest
specified by user and try to figure the name of the item it requires for repair
and return the name of that repair item to the user.

This is useful for mods with lots of repairable items descriptions of which don't
mention the item that is required for repairs.

How to use:
Copy the files from RepairWith directory into the Config directory of the mod
you want to work with and run repairwith.bat from there.

Note:
This tool is written in Python and requires Python installed. Works with Python 3.11.4.

If anyone's interested in compiled exe file that doesn't require Python installed, feel free to let me know.

It is still work in progress. Unfortunately the tool as is is not ideal and has its
flaws, but when it works it works fast, so it's better than manually searching through the mod files
yourself for every item. There is still a lot of room for improvement. Unfortunately Python is not my strongest
thing, so if anyone wants to pick up and improve, feel free to do so and please share the improved code!
